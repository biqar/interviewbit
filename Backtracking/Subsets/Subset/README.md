### Subset

Asked in: [Amazon](#) | [Microsoft](#)

Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.

    Note:
        1. Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
        2. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
        3. Also, the subsets should be sorted in ascending ( lexicographic ) order.
        4. The list is not necessarily sorted.
Example :

If S = [1,2,3], a solution is:
```
[
  [],
  [1],
  [1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [1, 3],
  [2],
  [2, 3],
  [3],
]
```
