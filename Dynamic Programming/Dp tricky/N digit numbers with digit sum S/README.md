### N digit numbers with digit sum S

Find out the number of `N` digit numbers, whose digits on being added equals to a given number `S`. Note that a valid number starts from digits `1-9` except the number `0` itself. i.e. leading zeroes are not allowed.

Since the answer can be large, output answer modulo `1000000007`

`N = 2, S = 4`
Valid numbers are `{22, 31, 13, 40}`
Hence output `4`.
