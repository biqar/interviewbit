### Length of Longest Subsequence

Asked in: [Microsoft](#)

Given an array of integers, `A` of length `N`, find the length of longest subsequence which is first increasing then decreasing.

Input Format:
```
The first and the only argument contains an integer array, A.
```

Output Format:
```
Return an integer representing the answer as described in the problem statement.
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= N <= 3000
1 <= A[i] <= 1e7
```

Example:
```
Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 1]

Output 1:
    3

Explanation 1:
    [1, 2, 1] is the longest subsequence.

Input 2:
    [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]

Output 2:
    6
    
Explanation 2:
    [1 2 10 4 2 1] is the longest subsequence.
