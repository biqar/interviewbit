### Sum Of Fibonacci Numbers

Asked in: [Google](#) [Facebook](#) [Amazon](#)

How many minimum numbers from `fibonacci` series are required such that sum of numbers should be equal to a given Number `N`?

**Note:** repetition of number is allowed.

Example:
```
N = 4
Fibonacci numbers : 1 1 2 3 5 .... so on
here 2 + 2 = 4
so minimum numbers will be 2
```
