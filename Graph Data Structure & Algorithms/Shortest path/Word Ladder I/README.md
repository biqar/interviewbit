# Word Ladder I

Asked in: [Google](#) | [Microsoft](#) | [Ebay](#)

## Problem Statement
Given two words A and B, and a dictionary, C, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from A to B, such that:

1. You must change exactly one character in every transformation.
2. Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary.

Note:
1. Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
2. All words have the same length.
3. All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.


Input Format:
```
The first argument of input contains a string, A.
The second argument of input contains a string, B.
The third argument of input contains an array of strings, C.
```
Output Format:
```
Return an integer representing the minimum number of steps required to change string A to string B.
```
Constraints:
```
1 <= length(A), length(B), length(C[i]) <= 25
1 <= length(C) <= 5e3
```
Example :
```
Input 1:
    A = "hit"
    B = "cog"
    C = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"]

Output 1:
    5

Explanation 1:
    "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
```
