# interviewbit

This repository is a collection of my solution code snippets that passed all the test cases on the InterviewBit. I have mostly used C/C++ for writing my solutions.

The only issue you will face running the code is there is no **main()** function attached with the solutions. Hence, the solutions won't directly execute standalone on your local IDE or compiler. For most of the problems, I have tried to attach the problem statement with I/O specifications so that you can write the **main()** funtion all by yourself and manage to take input in proper way.

Happy Coding!
